Provisioning, for example, is a use case most used. Users needing multiple teams with specific settings don't want to create them all manually. A company policy changes, and suddenly all GIF settings must change for all Teams. Doing something like that manually would be impossible. That's the reason we sometimes must develop against Microsoft Teams, and for that we are going to use the Microsoft Graph.},

  abstract  = {Modern applications need to send emails to the stakeholders, customers, or developers or anyone related to the application. There can be a scenario where the customer is placing an order in an e-commerce application. And once the order gets placed, it intimates the customer with the order and the dispatch status. If the order fails, it should notify the operations team to look into it. You can configure your SMTP server for mailing needs on a virtual machine on Azure. However, you will end up maintaining the virtual machine and spend cost and effort to keep the SMTP server up and running. To address this issue, Microsoft provides Graph API deployed on Azure and helps you interact with Microsoft 365 Core services. Using the Graph API, you can send emails.},

  abstract    = {The increase in connectivity and use of “smart” devices offers companies new possibilities to improve their efficiency by using digitalization. For example, booking of meeting rooms have gone from using a paper calendar to electronic booking. To enable both digital remote booking, as well as being able to book a room directly (as with a paper calendar) this project has developed a room manager system. The room manager is a device that provides a quick and intuitive way for employees to handle conference room booking. The project was started on behalf of the company ÅF, who would like to optimize their use of conference rooms.  The result was a fully functional touchscreen device built using a Raspberry Pi. The room manager integrates successfully with the existing calendar system used at ÅF and meets all the requirements set by ÅF. The device will be used to determine if a room manager system is worth investing in and may be used as a foundation for continued development. },
